# Takopi documentation

Takopi runs coding agents on your computer and bridges them to Telegram. Send tasks from anywhere, watch progress stream live, pick up when back at the terminal. Scale from quick one-offs to multi-project workflows with topics and parallel worktrees.

## Quick start

```bash
uv tool install -U yee88
yee88 --onboard
```

Onboarding walks you through bot setup and asks how you want to work. [Full install guide →](tutorials/install.md)

## Pick your workflow

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
-   :lucide-message-circle:{ .lg } **Assistant**

    ---

    Ongoing chat. New messages auto-continue; `/new` to reset.

    Best for: solo work, natural conversation flow.

    Forum topics bound to projects and branches.

    Best for: teams, organized multi-repo workflows.

-   :lucide-terminal:{ .lg } **Handoff**

    ---

    Reply-to-continue. Copy resume lines to your terminal.
