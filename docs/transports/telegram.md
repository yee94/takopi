# Telegram Transport

## Overview

`TelegramClient` is the single transport for Telegram writes. It owns a
`TelegramOutbox` that serializes send/edit/delete operations, applies
coalescing, and enforces rate limits + retry-after backoff.

This document captures current behavior so transport changes stay intentional.

## Flow

1. Engine CLI emits JSONL events.
2. We render progress on every step and diff against the last output.
3. Only deltas enqueue a Telegram edit.
4. High-value messages enqueue a send.
5. All writes go through the outbox.

## Incoming messages

`parse_incoming_update` accepts text messages and voice notes.

If voice transcription is enabled, takopi downloads the voice payload from Telegram,
transcribes it with OpenAI, and routes the transcript through the same command and
directive pipeline as typed text.

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

```toml
voice_transcription = true
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment. If transcription is enabled but the API key
is missing or the audio download fails, takopi replies with a short error and skips
the run.

## Forum topics (optional)

Takopi can bind Telegram forum topics to a project/branch and persist resume tokens
per topic, so replies keep the right context even after restarts.

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

```toml
[transports.telegram.topics]
enabled = true
scope = "auto" # auto | main | projects | all
```

Requirements:

- `main`: `chat_id` must be a forum-enabled supergroup (topics enabled).
- `projects`: each `projects.<alias>.chat_id` must point to a forum-enabled
  supergroup for that project.
- `all`: both the main chat and each project chat must be forum-enabled.
- `auto`: if any project chats are configured, uses `projects`; otherwise `main`.
- The bot needs the **Manage Topics** permission in the relevant chat(s).

Commands:

- `main`: `/topic <project> @branch` creates a topic in the main chat and binds it.
- `projects`: `/topic @branch` creates a topic in the project chat and binds it.
- `all`: use `/topic <project> @branch` in the main chat, or `/topic @branch` in
  project chats.
- `/ctx` inside a topic shows the bound context and stored session engines.
  `/ctx set ...` and `/ctx clear` update the binding.
- `/new` inside a topic clears stored resume tokens for that topic.

State is stored in `telegram_topics_state.json` alongside the config file.
Delete it to reset all topic bindings and stored sessions.

Note: main chat topics do not assume a default project; topics must be bound
before running without directives.

## Outbox model

- Single worker processes one op at a time.
- Each op is keyed; only one pending op per key.
- New ops with the same key overwrite the payload but **do not** reset
  `queued_at` (fairness).

Keys (include `chat_id` to avoid cross-chat collisions):

- `("edit", chat_id, message_id)` for edits (coalesced).
- `("delete", chat_id, message_id)` for deletes.
- `("send", chat_id, replace_message_id)` when replacing a progress message.
- Unique key for normal sends.

Scheduling:

- Ordered by `(priority, queued_at)`.
- Priorities: send=0, delete=1, edit=2.
- Within a priority tier, the oldest pending op runs first.

## Rate limiting + backoff

- Per-chat pacing is computed from `private_chat_rps` and `group_chat_rps`.
  Defaults: 1.0 msg/s for private, 20/60 msg/s for groups (≈1 message every 3s).
- Pacing is currently enforced via a single global `next_at`; per-chat
  `next_at` is a future consideration if we ever run multiple chats in parallel.
- The worker waits until `max(next_at, retry_at)` before executing the next op.
- On 429, `RetryAfter` is raised using `parameters.retry_after` when present;
  if missing, we fall back to a 5s delay. The outbox sets `retry_at` and
  requeues the op if no newer op for the same key has arrived.

## Error handling

- Non-429 errors are logged and dropped (no retry).
- On `RetryAfter`, the op is retried unless a newer op superseded the same key.

## Replace progress messages

`send_message(replace_message_id=...)`:

- Drops any pending edit for that progress message.
- Enqueues the send at highest priority.
- If the send succeeds, enqueues a delete for the old progress message.

This keeps the final message first and avoids deleting progress if the send
fails.

## getUpdates

`get_updates` bypasses the outbox and retries on `RetryAfter` by sleeping
for the provided delay.

## Close semantics

`TelegramClient.close()` shuts down the outbox and closes the HTTP client.
Pending ops are failed with `None` (best-effort).
